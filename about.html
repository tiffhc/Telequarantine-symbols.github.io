		<h1>About</h1>
		
		<p> Thank you to the following participants that made this research creation project possible </p>
		
			<h4> Backstory </h4>
			
			The initial ideal behind this research-creation project came from my own personal concern with how my peers, friends and loved ones
			have been doing during the current Covid19 global pandemic. 
			<br>
			Through recent discussions, I've come to discover that people are assimilating quarantine life
			very differently from one another. 
			<br>
			Thus, out of concern and curiosity, I decided to base my research creation project on this aspect. 
		
			<br><br>
			
			<h4> Inspirations </h4> 
			Throughout the research and planning phase of this project, I was inspired by the following projects/references:
			<ul>
				<li>I would like to cite Onodera's Exquisite Corpse-19 (EXC-19) as a huge inspiration for my own research creation project. 
				The collective creation process of my projects are inspired by hers. <a href="https://exc-19.com/">EXC-19</a></li>
				<br> 
				<li>For the display of the symbolic cards via a website, I wanted to thank the reference to Jonathan Harris's The Web's secret stories for also being a big inspiration
				to my own final project <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/jonathan_harris_the_web_s_secret_stories?language=en">The Web's secret stories</a></li> 
			</ul>
			
			<h4> Process </h4> 
			
			My curiosity and concern for people's experience in living in quarantine led me to decide upon a participatory project. I wanted to gather participants and do a collective creation altogether.
			<br>
			Similar to a telephone game-like creative process, I planned out three phases for the participants to do.
