		<h1>About</h1>
			
			The initial ideal behind this research-creation project came from my own personal concern with how my peers, friends and loved ones
			have been doing during the current Covid19 global pandemic. 
			Through recent discussions, I've come to discover that people are assimilating quarantine life
			very differently from one another. 
			
			Thus, out of concern and curiosity, I decided to base my research creation project on this aspect. 
		
			
			<h2> Inspirations </h2> 
			Throughout the research and planning phase of this project, I was inspired by the following projects/references:
			<ul id="inspo">
				<li>I would like to cite Onodera's Exquisite Corpse-19 (EXC-19) as a huge inspiration for my own research creation project. 
				The collective creation process of my projects are inspired by hers. <a href="https://exc-19.com/">EXC-19</a></li>
				
				<li>For the display of the symbolic cards via a website, I wanted to thank the reference to Jonathan Harris's The Web's secret stories for also being a big inspiration
				to my own final project <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/jonathan_harris_the_web_s_secret_stories?language=en">The Web's secret stories</a></li> 
			</ul>
			
			<h2> Process </h2> 
			
			My curiosity and concern for people's experience in living in quarantine led me to decide upon a participatory project. I wanted to gather participants and do a collective creation altogether.
			<br>
			Similar to a telephone game-like creative process, I planned out three phases for the participants to do. 
			
			<ul>
				<li>
					<h3> Step 1: A word </h3>
					Participants in this phased filled out a google form that asked for their persmission to used and present their data creatively and publicly (with consent).
					<br>
					They were then asked to give a word that SYMBOLIZED their experience living in quarantine admist the Covid19 pandemic. 
				</li> 
				
				<li>
					<h3> Step 2: A sketch </h3>
					Participants in this phased are given a random word from phase 1(not the same as their own) that was shuffled by me. They return to me a sketch within a quarter of a A4 paper size. 
				</li> 
				
				<li>
					<h3> Step 3: Keywords and Description </h3>
					Participants in this phased are given a random sketch from phase 2(not the same as their own) that was shuffled by me.
					They return to me up to 5 keywords and a description of up to 20 words. 
				
				</li>
